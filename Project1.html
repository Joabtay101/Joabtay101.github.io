  <h1>Computational Intelligence Techniques Applied to the Productivity Prediction Data of Garment Employees</h1>

  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved developing machine learning models to classify garment employee productivity as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. 
    I used Python with NumPy, Keras, and Matplotlib to preprocess data, train models, and analyse results.
  </p>

  <!-- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering -->
  <h2>Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset included various workplace metrics such as efficiency, overtime hours, and department type. 
    I handled missing values, normalised numerical features, and encoded categorical data to ensure optimal model performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Feature Distributions</h3>
  <p>
    The bar graphs below visualise feature distributions in the dataset after handling missing values and preparing the data for modelling.

  <!-- Model Development & Evaluation -->
  <h2>Model Development & Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    I implemented multiple classification models, starting with a simple neural network using Keras. I experimented with different activation 
    functions, hidden layers, and dropout rates. I also compared the neural network's performance with a Random Forest classifier, 
    which handled imbalanced data more effectively.
  </p>

  <h3>Performance Comparison</h3>
  <p>
    The plot below visualises the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of different models tested throughout the project. 
    This helped identify the best-performing approach for classifying employee productivity.
