  <h1>Computational Intelligence Techniques Applied to the Productivity Prediction Data of Garment Employees</h1>

  <!-- Project Description -->
  <p>This project aimed to develop predictive models using computational intelligence techniques to classify garment employees' productivity as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The dataset provided information about various employee features, including work habits, output, and personal details. By applying machine learning algorithms, I aimed to optimise productivity prediction and improve workforce management decisions.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>For this project, I implemented several machine learning models, starting with a neural network model built from scratch using Python and Keras. I also used NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing. After evaluating the performance of the neural network, I compared it to a random forest classifier to determine which approach yielded better results. I utilised evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance in classifying employee productivity.</p>

  <h2>Results and Findings</h2>
  <p>The neural network model performed well with a moderate accuracy rate, while the random forest classifier outperformed the neural network in terms of both accuracy and precision. This comparison helped identify which computational intelligence technique was more suited for this classification task. The results suggested that ensemble methods like random forests are effective in handling complex datasets with mixed features. Visualisations, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves, were used to illustrate the models' performance in distinguishing between satisfactory and unsatisfactory productivity.</p>
