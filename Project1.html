  <!-- Project Overview -->
  <section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing machine learning models to classify garment employee productivity as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. 
      The challenge was to handle an imbalanced dataset and identify key factors influencing productivity. I used Python with libraries such as NumPy, 
      Keras, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, and results analysis. The end goal was to implement a model that could be deployed 
      in a real-world setting to aid decision-making in garment factories.

  <!-- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering -->

    <h2>Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      The dataset included various workplace metrics such as efficiency, overtime hours, and department type. I handled missing values, 
      normalised numerical features, and encoded categorical data to ensure optimal model performance. A major part of this stage was to 
      apply feature engineering, creating new variables and transforming existing ones to better capture patterns in the data.
    </p>
    <h3>Feature Distributions</h3>
    <p>
      The bar graphs below visualise the distributions of features in the dataset after preprocessing and preparing the data for modelling. 
      These feature distributions were key in understanding the structure of the data and helped inform the model-building process.

  <!-- Model Development & Evaluation -->
  <section>
    <h2>Model Development & Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      For model development, I started with a simple neural network architecture built using Keras. This model used one hidden layer with a 
      ReLU activation function, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. After experimenting with various hyperparameters such as learning rate 
      and dropout rate, I explored more advanced models, including Random Forests. The Random Forest classifier outperformed the neural network in 
      handling imbalanced data and provided better generalization on unseen data. 
    </p>
    <h3>Performance Comparison</h3>
    <p>
      The plot below visualises the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models tested throughout the project. These metrics were 
      essential in evaluating the effectiveness of the models and identifying the best-performing approach for classifying employee productivity.

  <!-- Key Takeaways -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Refined my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I developed a deep understanding of how to 
          handle real-world datasets, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.</li>
      <li>Gained experience in hyperparameter tuning and optimising deep learning models. Through trial and error, I fine-tuned the neural 
          network’s architecture and dropout rates to prevent overfitting.</li>
      <li>Learned to compare multiple machine learning models and select the best one for a given task. The performance of the neural network 
          was significantly improved by using Random Forest, which is particularly good at handling imbalanced data.</li>
      <li>Worked with Keras and Scikit-learn, which are powerful tools for building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.</li>
      <li>Honed my skills in presenting complex results through visualizations, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret key findings and make data-driven decisions.</li>
